# AgriGuard üåø

**AgriGuard** is an intelligent plant health assistant designed to help identify plant diseases with high accuracy. This application allows users to upload an image of a plant leaf, analyze it using a CNN model, and receive predictions about potential diseases. AgriGuard is ideal for farmers, agronomists, and researchers aiming to ensure plant health and improve agricultural productivity.

## Project Overview
AgriGuard leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on a dataset of plant leaf images. The model can classify leaves into 38 categories, identifying both the type of plant and the specific disease (if any). AgriGuard‚Äôs user-friendly interface, built with Streamlit, provides an intuitive experience for users to upload images and quickly receive prediction results.

---

## Features
- **Disease Detection**: Upload an image of a plant leaf, and AgriGuard predicts if it has any disease, along with the specific disease type.
- **Top-3 Predictions**: The system provides the top-3 likely diseases for each image, along with confidence scores.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A fast and responsive user interface built with Streamlit.
- **Downloadable Report**: After predictions, users can download a text report of the results.

## Installation
To run AgriGuard locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Agriguard.git
    cd Agriguard
    ```

2. **Install Requirements**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download the Model**:
   Place your trained model file (`Trained_model.keras`) in the project directory.

4. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage
1. Launch the application using `streamlit run app.py`.
2. Navigate to the "Disease Recognition" page.
3. Upload a plant leaf image (formats supported: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`).
4. Click on **Predict üîç** to see the results.
5. Download the prediction report if needed.

## Dataset
The dataset used to train this model consists of 87,000 images of healthy and diseased leaves, divided into 38 classes. The dataset can be accessed from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset).

- **Train**: 70,295 images
- **Validation**: 17,572 images
- **Test**: 33 images

## Model Details
AgriGuard uses a CNN model trained on a large dataset of plant leaves, allowing it to identify various diseases with high accuracy. The model predicts the disease and displays the top-3 results with confidence scores.

## Future Improvements
- Add more plant species and diseases.
- Develop a mobile version of AgriGuard.
- Provide disease severity insights and treatment recommendations.
